DIRADM README
=============

What is diradm?
---------------

diradm is a simple bash script for managing posix users and groups stored
in a LDAP directory, offering the same features as the traditional passwd
file utilities useradd/usermod/userdel and groupadd/groupmod/groupdel.
It uses the utils ldapsearch, ldapadd, ldapmodify and ldapdelete from the
OpenLDAP project (http://www.openldap.org/) to perform the needed queries
against the LDAP database.


Installation
------------

Just copy the script itself (diradm) to a location you want it to reside
(usually /usr/local/sbin or somewhere else within your path), then take a
look at the configuration file (diradm.conf), adjust it to your needs and
copy it to an appropriate location as well.
By default diradm will search for its config at /etc/diradm.conf, but its
behaviour can be changed by editing the script and adjusting the variable
CONFIG.


How do I use it?
----------------

If you know the usage of the traditional password file maintainance tools
useradd/usermod/userdel and groupadd/groupmod/groupdel, you are ready to
use diradm. Its first command line parameter tells it which operation to
perform, taking exactly the same options as its "flat file equivalent".
E.g. "diradm useradd -m -c "Testuser" -g group1 -G group2,group3 testusr"
For further information on command line options please take a look at the
man pages of useradd/usermod/userdel and groupadd/groupmod/groupdel.
