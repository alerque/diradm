DIRADM CHANGES
==============

2003-06-22  Daniel Himler  <dan@hits.at>

	* Command line arguments now get parsed using bash's internal getopts
	  construct, replacing the obsolete and less powerful getopt external
	  command.

	* Modifying multiple attributes of a user at once should now work.

	* diradm doesn't check for the existence of the primary group anymore
	  when modifying a user without actually changing the group attribute.
	  Also fixed typo "Adding user anyway." in this warning message.

	* Added usermod option "-h" to modify the host attribute for a user.

	* Added option "--version" to display version information.

	* Added option "--help" to display the usage with exit status 0.

	* Updated version number to 1.1.


2003-06-17  Andreas de Pretis  <andreas@depretis.at>

	* Added useradd option "-h" to set the host attribute for a user.

	* diradm now checks for existence of a home directory before trying to
	  create it.

	* diradm now checks the ownership of a home directory before removing
	  it. A home directory not owned by the user won't get deleted anymore.
